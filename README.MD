**Footy Data Displayer**

_Version 0.0.1_

Through the primary use of the ‘Dash’ package in Python 3, this project aims to gather both old and new data by scraping across various webpages. Upon the collection of the material, Dash will be used to display the data on a web page. The scraped data will predominantly present player information, data between matches, and eventually also leading to machine learning.
